    <content type="html"><![CDATA[Every year my work has a competition for who can come up with the best Halloween decorations. My team has the good
fortune of being in a large conference room, which gave us a distinct advantage over the pod layout elsewhere
in the building. Our team's resident creative genius [Sheena](https://twitter.com/SheenaEllenburg) came up with
the concept of dead pirates / death in the deep. As a companion to our pirate costumes, I created a basic
pirate sword design with a curved blade:

{% img /assets/2015-11-01-pirate-swords/images/sword-collage.jpg auto auto %}

I cut the swords out of a sheet of 1/2" cabinet grade plywood. This is important because it has a flat and smooth
pre-finished surface, which I found very easy to prime and spray paint. I used silver metallic paint for the blade
portion and then used a metallic bronze for the hilt. Painters tape was used as masking to provide a sharp line between
the two colors.

{% img /assets/2015-11-01-pirate-swords/images/final-sword.jpg auto auto %}

As a final touch, I used a hot glue gun to attach 1/8" leather cord to the handle of the hilt.

Here are the sword designs in various formats, if you want to make your own:

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[Looking forward to sunshine and warmer temperatures, I decided to take on a project over the weekend to build
a small raised bed so we could try planting some peppers and herbs this spring. My wife asked that the bed be
around 18" tall. I went to work in my project notebook and came up with the following hand sketch:

{% img /assets/2015-04-13-building-a-custom-machined-raised-bed/hand-sketch.jpg auto auto %}

I wanted to use 4" x 4" posts for the corners and 2" x 6" boards for the walls of the planter box. There were a
couple of design elements that I wanted to incorporate. First, I wanted the 2" x 6" boards to be recessed into
the post. Also, I wanted to put a 45 degree chamfer on the top of each 4" x 4" for decoration. I decided
that the overall dimensions should be around 36" x 60" so I could maximize utilization of the 8 foot lengths
of the 2" x 6" stock board size.

**Materials**

<!-- more -->

I went to Home Depot to source the lumber. I found all of the boards to be quite wet as if they had just been brought
in from outside and tried to find boards that were relatively straight. Turning the boards vertically and looking down
the edge makes it easy to identify which ones were straighter.

The boards were cut to the following dimensions and quantities:


    1 @ 4&#8221; x 4&#8221; x 96&#8221; (around $9 / each) cut to 4 pieces @ 18&#8221; long
    6 @ 2&#8221; x 6&#8221; x 96&#8221; (around $8 / each) split into 6 pieces @ 36&#8221; long and 6 pieces @ 60&#8221; long


I asked that the sawyer cut the pieces the same size. I did not care that the pieces were exactly 36&#8221; or 60&#8221;, but
it was important to me that they were all the same. The parts came out with about 0.125&#8221; of variation. A more
experienced sawyer using a stop on the saw, should be able to cut the parts to close tolerances.

{% img left /assets/2015-04-13-building-a-custom-machined-raised-bed/soil.jpg 300 auto %}

I also purchased potting soil, which is sold in 3 cubic foot bags at Home Depot. The soil should be
be a few inches below the 18&#8221; post. Here is how I calculated the amount of soil I needed for the project:

    16&#8221; x 36&#8221; x 60&#8221; = 34,560 in^3 / (1,728 in^3 / 1 foot^3)
    = 20 feet^3

The calculation suggested that about six or seven bags were needed. I decided to go for three bags of garden soil
($8.50 / each) and three bags of raised bed and potting mix ($10 / each). The garden soil would comprise the lower
layer and the raised bed mix would be on the top.

With the boards and soil in hand, I headed home for the next part of the project.

**Fabrication**

The key to putting a slot the 4&#8221; x 4&#8221; post would be to create a small fixture that would hold the part in place
during the machining process. My CNC router imparts several pounds of force into the work and it is important
that the work is held securely in place to ensure a good quality part. The 4&#8221; x 4&#8221; posts were about 3.625&#8221; square.
I came up with the following shop drawing:

{% img /assets/2015-04-13-building-a-custom-machined-raised-bed/drawing.png auto auto %}

I used a 23.5&#8221; x 11.25&#8221; scrap of plywood for the base of the fixture. I held this down using
my table&#8217;s vacuum fixture and cut a trace of approximate size of the 4&#8221; x 4&#8221; x 18&#8221; board about 0.02&#8221; deep. The
critical dimension here is the 3.625&#8221; width. I fastened a 2&#8221; x 2&#8221; block right along the long edge of the trace and then
put an angle bracket along the end.

{% img /assets/2015-04-13-building-a-custom-machined-raised-bed/fixture.jpg auto auto %}

Finally I wrapped a 4&#8221; x 4&#8221; x 18&#8221; cut piece in paper and put it up against the two edges. The paper allows for about
0.01&#8221; extra spacing. Then I installed two final angle brackets ensuring a snug fit. It is important to be able
to move all of the 4&#8221; x 4&#8221;s in and out of the fixture. I tested each 4&#8221; x 4&#8221; and rotated each 90 degrees in the
tool.

I put two screws though the angle brackets into the work to hold it in place while the router was running. The
run time was about 10 minutes per pocket. This video shows the pocket being machining:
{% youtube b4Hyl-paMj4 %}

The next operation was to put a 0.25&#8221; x 45 degree chamfer on the top of each post. This operation was performed on
the manual router table:

{% img /assets/2015-04-13-building-a-custom-machined-raised-bed/chamfer.jpg auto auto %}

Finally, I needed to added some pilot holes and countersunk holes to make assembly easier. First I made marks at
5.5&#8221; and 11&#8221; inches. These are the approximate locations of the boards from the edge of the pocket (close to
the top of the post). Then I added marks roughly 2&#8221; on center. For one pocket I drilled through holes at 1&#8221; and 3&#8221;
from the top of each board. Then for the other pocket I drilled holes at 2&#8221; and 4&#8221; from the top of each board. This
ensured that the screws would not intersect in the middle of the post:

{% img /assets/2015-04-13-building-a-custom-machined-raised-bed/holes.jpg auto auto %}

The last operation was to reverse drill the pilot holes with a countersink bit on the drill press. I recessed the
countersink roughly 0.5&#8221; into the board to hide the 4&#8221; galvanized screws that I purchased. The
one pound box ($7.50) contained 50 screws and I needed 48 to do the job (12 boards x 4 fasteners per board):

{% img /assets/2015-04-13-building-a-custom-machined-raised-bed/countersink.jpg auto auto %}

**Assembly**

With the fabrication complete, I took all of the parts outside on the sidewalk. Assembly was a snap. I started by
turning the 4&#8221; x 4&#8221; posts upside down so the chamfered top was on the sidewalk. I put each 2&#8221; x 6&#8221; post into the slot,
tapped the 4&#8221; x 4&#8221; posts towards each other and then put in the 4&#8221; long screws. I fastened each board one at a
time, working my way up:

{% img /assets/2015-04-13-building-a-custom-machined-raised-bed/assembly.jpg auto auto %}

After about 20 minutes with the drill, the raised bed frame was complete. I flipped the assembly over and positioned
it next to the sidewalk. We put cardboard in the bottom of the box after reading good things about it. Finally, the
six bags of soil went into the box. After each bag we used the rake and a shovel to even things out.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[This year we decided to take on a small project to help decorate the front yard for Halloween. We were sad to lose our dear orange tabby cat Frank this July. To memorialize Frank and our pets from years past, we decided to create a small faux pet cemetary in the front yard.

Here are the raw materials we used:

- 1" x 48" x 96" Owens Corning FOAMULAR insulation (about $20, Home Depot)
- Grey and black spray primer (about $6 each)
- 5x Paint mixing sticks (free, Home Depot)
- 10x 1 1/4" long wood screws

**Cutting the foam**
<!-- more -->

My wife who is a graphic designer created the geometry for the project [download here](/assets/2014-10-25-pet-cemetery-headstones/files/petcemetary.zip). The PDF files can be enlarged to a desired size on paper and then cut out with a pair of scissors. You can print large format sheets at a copy center or use regular copier paper taped together to form a template. I used the PDF files in my CAD / CAM software and cut the patterns out on my CNC router.

{% img left /assets/2014-10-25-pet-cemetery-headstones/images/pre-finished.jpg 300 auto Pre-finished Headstones %}

The Corning foam can be fabricated with a utility knife, hot knife or a router. The best cut can probably be achieved with a small router or a Dremel tool. In addition, I found that the material was hand-sandable. I would experiment to find which tools work best for you. This [guide](http://insulation.owenscorning.com/assets/0/428/429/465/07b971b3-5112-46b7-a783-1f7132b59897.pdf) from the manufacturer has some fabrication tips. If I did the project again, I would consider hand drawing the letters / designs or using stencils.

*Transportation note:* We had a gentleman at Home Depot cut the foam sheet so it would fit in the back of my car. The guide shows a trick for breaking the sheet. You can take a box cutter and run it along a straight-edge (a 2&#8221; x 4&#8221; in our case) a couple of times. Then you can break the sheet along the score line by pushing down in one swift motion over the edge of a table (or in our case a stack of plywood sheet).

** Painting the headstones **

{% img right /assets/2014-10-25-pet-cemetery-headstones/images/stake.jpg 400 auto Stake with Headstone %}

Our goal was to give the headstones the an aged, dirty appearance. We started with the black spray primer with long strokes perhaps 6-12&#8221; away from the headstone. Start with short bursts of spray and take care not to stay in one spot. Cover the front, back and the edges until the purple color of the foam is not noticeable. Let dry and apply another coat as necessary. Then we applied the grey primer in streaks around the head stones. You may want to alternate between the grey and black primer to achieve the desired effect.

** Installing the headstones **

{% img left /assets/2014-10-25-pet-cemetery-headstones/images/collage.jpg 400 auto Headstone Collage %}

I cut the paint mixing sticks on a compound miter saw into the form of a V on one end (pictured above). This allows the sticks to be used as a stake. These were driven several inches deep into the ground (perhaps 5-7&#8221;). I used a small 3-pound sledge to drive these into the group taking care not to split the wood. You may consider putting a small piece of wood behind the stake to help distribute the load a little bit. This should help to minimize splitting.

After the stake was in the ground, I drilled a pilot hole through each stake about 1-2&#8221; from the top. Then I centered the headstone in front of each stake. While pushing down slightly on the headstone, I drove a wood screw from the front face about 1&#8221; from the bottom back into the stake through the foam. Then from the back, I put a screw in through the pilot hole into the back of the foam. Take care to drill slowly and softly as it will be pretty easy to drive a screw right through the foam.

Have fun time decorating this year and have a safe and happy Halloween!

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes it is difficult as a software engineer to feel connected to our work product. At the end of the day, what can be demonstrated and communicated to others? It is a little easier when developing user interfaces as at least we have something we can show visually. A more cynical view is that all we did today is change some bits in a computer. This is why I like working with wood. I come up with an idea and am rewarded by seeing its physical instantiation.

{% img left /assets/2014-07-26-wood-boards-from-voronoi-diagrams/images/voronoi.png 300 auto Voronoi Diagram %}

I find that projects that engage both the analytical and creative parts of my brain are especially fun. Last summer I started making some custom wooden parts based on Voronoi Diagrams (at left).

First, a number of seed points are generated. Then the space is divided into Voronoi regions, which are sets of points closest to a seed point than any other. Typically, each region has a randomly generated color. The black dots in the image indicate the location of the seed points.

First, we will create a small helper class that will encapsulate a point's position and help us calculate the distance to a given pixel. 

<!-- more -->

{% codeblock lang:rb %}
class Point
  attr_reader :x, :y
  def initialize(x, y)
    @x = x
    @y = y
  end

  def distanceTo(x, y)
    deltaX = (x - @x).abs
    deltaY = (y - @y).abs
    Math.sqrt(deltaX ** 2 + deltaY ** 2) # Euclidean distance
    # deltaX + deltaY # Manhattan distance
  end

  def self.random(max_x, max_y)
    Point.new(Random.rand(max_x), Random.rand(max_y))
  end
end
{% endcodeblock %}

I&#8217;ve added a class factory method that returns new random Points. This will help us later when we generate seed points.

Let&#8217;s take a look at the main part of the Voronoi Diagram generation algorithm:

{% codeblock lang:rb %}
require &#8216;chunky_png&#8217;
require_relative &#8216;point&#8217;

# Image size and voronoi seed sites
width = 512
height = 512
sites = 20

# Create seed points and associated colors
seed_points = sites.times.map { Point.random(width, height) }
seed_region_colors = sites.times.map { ChunkyPNG::Color.rgb(Random.rand(256), Random.rand(256), Random.rand(256)) }

# Initialize a new image
png = ChunkyPNG::Image.new(width, height, ChunkyPNG::Color::TRANSPARENT)

# Iterate over all pixels in the image
(0&#8230;width).each do |x|
  (0&#8230;height).each do |y|
    closest_index = -1
    closest_distance = width * height + 1
    # Determine the closest seed point
    seed_points.each_with_index do |point, index|
      distance = point.distanceTo(x, y)
      if distance < closest_distance
        closest_distance = distance
        closest_index = index
      end
    end
    png[x, y] = seed_region_colors[closest_index]
  end
end

# Show seed points
seed_points.each do |point|
  png.circle(point.x, point.y, 2, ChunkyPNG::Color::BLACK, ChunkyPNG::Color::BLACK)
end
{% endcodeblock %}

The `width`, `height` and `sites` are parameters to the Voronoi diagram. They determine the width and height of the image as well as the number of seed points.

It should be noted that this code is particularly inefficient; it is written more for clarity than for speed. Several efficient algorithms exist. One of the best known is [Fortune's algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune%27s_algorithm) and runs in O(n log n) time. Several open source implementations are available online.

We use [Chunky PNG](https://github.com/wvanbergen/chunky_png) to help us create the PNG output file.

<strong>Fabricated Wooden Boards</strong>

The first wall art piece is fabricated from 1/2&#8221; thick cherry and paduak

Vector files are required to import designs into my CAD / CAM software. I used Raymond Hill&#8217;s [Javascript Voronoi](https://github.com/gorhill/Javascript-Voronoi) library, [Raphaël](http://raphaeljs.com) and [Raphaël Export](https://github.com/ElbertF/Raphael.Export) to generate SVG files. Two software tools were used to massage the geometry into something that could be machined: Autodesk&#8217;s [AutoCAD](http://www.autodesk.com/products/autocad/)&reg; and Vectric&#8217;s [Aspire](http://www.vectric.com/products/aspire.html)&reg;. The parts had to be machined precisely on a CNC router so that they could be nested and glued together as portrayed in the images below.

I spent a week over the winter at 8,500 feet in the mountains at Old Sky Valley Ranch near Tabernash, Colorado. It is an inspiring place and I undertook a project with fellow GIS developer Nicholas Hallahan (https://github.com/hallahan/ http://www.spatialdev.com/#about) to craft a gift for one of the ranch families.

The project involved quite a bit of GIS modeling and graphic design work. The spatial data was obtained from a variety of sources including the USGS National Map Viewer (http://viewer.nationalmap.gov/viewer/) where we found the contour data. We also obtained some of the road, hydrology, and cadastral (building footprints) data from the Grand County, CO GIS Department (http://co.grand.co.us/170/Digital-Data-Sets). Much of the fine grained details of this data were missing, such as some of the less develped roads and the precision of bends of the rivers and streams. This was achieved by hand digitizing from satellite imagery features that were missing in OpenStreetMap and then importing that final product. This part was a lot of fun, and in turn we got a new feeling and perspective of the geography of the area.

<!-- more -->

{% img right /images/colorado-mid-scale.jpg 350 auto Mid scale map %}

Once all of the source data was gathered, we used ArcGIS to filter out unwanted features and narrow down the area of the data to the extent of the map we wanted to produce. The work was further cleaned up in Adobe Illustrator.

Although ArcGIS is well equipped to edit vector data, it focuses on this data in a geographic context, and we needed to specify details in the final, printable vector format. This is where Adobe Illustrator comes in. Here we were able to carefully specify line widths as well as place labels for these lines. The most important part of this process was separating different features into different layers that would be cut (burned) with different settings and intensities by the laser.

Computer Numerical Controlled (CNC) machine tools are robots that help automate the process of making custom parts. They typically involve the use of computer aided design (CAD) and computer aided manufacturing (CAM) software tools. The main benefit of CNC tools is both that they automate the manufacturing process and are precise. In recent years CNC machines have become much more affordable. For example, small CNC routers that can cut wood, plastics and light metals are commercially available for a few thousand dollars (USD).

Creating the lazy susan involved several steps that included both a CNC router and CNC laser. Carbonized 3/4&#8221; thick three-ply natural bamboo plywood sheet was selected due to its light color and durability. A 17&#8221; diameter circle was cut out on a CNC router. We used ADX Portland (http://www.adxportland.com) for their CNC laser service (they have an 18&#8221; x 24&#8221; table). We were able to index the part on the laser table by first cutting a 17&#8221; diameter disk in a thin piece of cardboard. We could then locate the same-sized bamboo disk into the hole we cut in the cardboard.

CNC lasers can be configured to cut in either a vector or raster mode. Vectors cutting is best for lines and arcs that are precisely (aka mathematically) defined. Raster cutting is better for laser engraving and is ideal for filled areas and photographs. Our project required both raster and vector cut modes. The raster mode was used to fill in the lakes and the interiors of the letters. The vector mode was used for the contour lines and letter outlines. 

Map details look best when line weights are taken into consideration. While the laser typically cuts lines the same thickness in vector mode, we found that we could cut wider lines by defocusing the laser. This was achieved by setting the Z-home position roughly 1/8&#8221; or 3/16&#8221; above the part instead of on the part. Without this hack, we would have needed to do the burning in a &#8220;raster&#8221; mode in which the machine burns in a pixel-based mannor similiar to what you would see with an ink jet printer. This would have taken a very long time, and we were charged by the minute.

To finish up the part we went back to the CNC router to pocket it out for the lazy susan mechanism. The 9&#8221; turntable was obtained from Tap Plastics (http://www.tapplastics.com/). While the pocket diameter was 9-1/16&#8221;, the depth was slightly less than the height of the mechanism. This allows the turntable to support the bamboo piece up off of the table. Finally, mineral oil was used to finish the part and protect it. Mineral oil is both food safe, readily available (check your local drug store) and brings out color the natural bamboo.
