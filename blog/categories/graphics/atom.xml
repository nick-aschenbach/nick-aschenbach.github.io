    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I needed to incorporate smooth color transitions into a few projects I worked on several months ago. I wrote a 3D virtual terrain generator and wanted to color areas based on altitude. Higher elevations should be colored white (mountains), medium elevations should be colored green (grass) and lower elevations should be colored blue (water). A second application for these transitions was a series of particle systems (see video below). Changing particle color as a function of age allows effects like fading to black before a particle is removed. We will come back to particle systems later with a small demo at the end of this post.</p>

<p><div class="embed-video-container"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/-urfsS1OpYo" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></p>

<p>To achieve color transitions in my programs, I figured that raster images with color gradients could be used. Programs like Adobe Photoshop or <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a> are excellent tools to use for this purpose. As an aside, I also enjoy using the ColorZilla <a href="http://www.colorzilla.com/gradient-editor/">Ultimate CSS Gradient Editor</a> for web projects. The problem I faced was getting red, blue and green values at each pixel along the gradient into code.</p>

<p>I found quite a few libraries that could read images. ImageMagick is a powerful set of tools that enable reading and writing over 100 image formats. It has interfaces for a <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/script/api.php">number of languages</a>. However, I was looking for something light-weight and self contained.</p>

<p>I found an easy-to-use gem called <a href="https://github.com/wvanbergen/chunky_png">Chunky PNG</a> that allows developers to read and write PNG files. Here is a snippet of code that shows how to open and read a PNG file in Ruby:</p>

<p>While this gem is written in 100% Ruby, there is a gem extension library that speeds up Chunky called <a href="https://github.com/wvanbergen/oily_png">Oily PNG</a>. It optimizes some operations like encoding and decoding PNG files using native C code.</p>

<p>By taking PNG files as input and generating Java code as output, I found that I could save a lot of time and be more flexible with changing color transitions than if I had typed out the code by hand. This is easy to do:</p>

<p>I ended up generating about 40 images that I used in conjuncton with a small color gradient manager library in Java. The source code and generator are available on <a href="https://github.com/nick-aschenbach/code-generated-color-gradients">Github</a>. This example shows its use:</p>

<p>I decided to modify the generator a little bit to output code for Javascript and used it for a simple particle system simulation (available on <a href="https://github.com/nick-aschenbach/particle-system-color-gradients">Github</a>). The color gradients can be changed out dynamically via the drop down box.</p>

    <id>http://nick-aschenbach.github.io/blog/2014/07/14/laser-etched-map-lazy-susan</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="/images/colorado-mountains.jpg" title="Snowy view towards Devil&rsquo;s Thumb Ranch" ></p>

<p>I spent a week over the winter at 8,500 feet in the mountains at Old Sky Valley Ranch near Tabernash, Colorado. It is an inspiring place and I undertook a project with fellow GIS developer Nicholas Hallahan (<a href="https://github.com/hallahan/">https://github.com/hallahan/</a> <a href="http://www.spatialdev.com/#about">http://www.spatialdev.com/#about</a>) to craft a gift for one of the ranch families.</p>

<p>The project involved quite a bit of GIS modeling and graphic design work. The spatial data was obtained from a variety of sources including the USGS National Map Viewer (<a href="http://viewer.nationalmap.gov/viewer/">http://viewer.nationalmap.gov/viewer/</a>) where we found the contour data. We also obtained some of the road, hydrology, and cadastral (building footprints) data from the Grand County, CO GIS Department (<a href="http://co.grand.co.us/170/Digital-Data-Sets">http://co.grand.co.us/170/Digital-Data-Sets</a>). Much of the fine grained details of this data were missing, such as some of the less develped roads and the precision of bends of the rivers and streams. This was achieved by hand digitizing from satellite imagery features that were missing in OpenStreetMap and then importing that final product. This part was a lot of fun, and in turn we got a new feeling and perspective of the geography of the area.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><img class="right" src="/images/colorado-mid-scale.jpg" width="350" title="auto Mid scale map" ></p>

<p>Once all of the source data was gathered, we used ArcGIS to filter out unwanted features and narrow down the area of the data to the extent of the map we wanted to produce. The work was further cleaned up in Adobe Illustrator.</p>

<p>Although ArcGIS is well equipped to edit vector data, it focuses on this data in a geographic context, and we needed to specify details in the final, printable vector format. This is where Adobe Illustrator comes in. Here we were able to carefully specify line widths as well as place labels for these lines. The most important part of this process was separating different features into different layers that would be cut (burned) with different settings and intensities by the laser.</p>

<p>Computer Numerical Controlled (CNC) machine tools are robots that help automate the process of making custom parts. They typically involve the use of computer aided design (CAD) and computer aided manufacturing (CAM) software tools. The main benefit of CNC tools is both that they automate the manufacturing process and are precise. In recent years CNC machines have become much more affordable. For example, small CNC routers that can cut wood, plastics and light metals are commercially available for a few thousand dollars (USD).</p>

<p>Creating the lazy susan involved several steps that included both a CNC router and CNC laser. Carbonized &frac34;" thick three-ply natural bamboo plywood sheet was selected due to its light color and durability. A 17" diameter circle was cut out on a CNC router. We used ADX Portland (<a href="http://www.adxportland.com">http://www.adxportland.com</a>) for their CNC laser service (they have an 18" x 24" table). We were able to index the part on the laser table by first cutting a 17" diameter disk in a thin piece of cardboard. We could then locate the same-sized bamboo disk into the hole we cut in the cardboard.</p>

<p>CNC lasers can be configured to cut in either a vector or raster mode. Vectors cutting is best for lines and arcs that are precisely (aka mathematically) defined. Raster cutting is better for laser engraving and is ideal for filled areas and photographs. Our project required both raster and vector cut modes. The raster mode was used to fill in the lakes and the interiors of the letters. The vector mode was used for the contour lines and letter outlines.</p>

<p>Map details look best when line weights are taken into consideration. While the laser typically cuts lines the same thickness in vector mode, we found that we could cut wider lines by defocusing the laser. This was achieved by setting the Z-home position roughly 1/8" or 3/16" above the part instead of on the part. Without this hack, we would have needed to do the burning in a &ldquo;raster&rdquo; mode in which the machine burns in a pixel-based mannor similiar to what you would see with an ink jet printer. This would have taken a very long time, and we were charged by the minute.</p>

<p>To finish up the part we went back to the CNC router to pocket it out for the lazy susan mechanism. The 9" turntable was obtained from Tap Plastics (<a href="http://www.tapplastics.com/">http://www.tapplastics.com/</a>). While the pocket diameter was 9-1/16", the depth was slightly less than the height of the mechanism. This allows the turntable to support the bamboo piece up off of the table. Finally, mineral oil was used to finish the part and protect it. Mineral oil is both food safe, readily available (check your local drug store) and brings out color the natural bamboo.</p>

    <link href="http://nick-aschenbach.github.io/blog/2014/07/06/2d-fractal-terrain/"/>
    <updated>2014-07-06T08:26:04-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://nick-aschenbach.github.io/blog/2014/07/06/2d-fractal-terrain</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A while ago I discovered a simple algorithm to generate infinite fractal terrain. One application for this is to produce mountain-like backgrounds for 2D side-scrolling video games.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/fractal-2d.png" title="Evolution of a fractal mountain" ></p>

<p>This is called the midpoint displacement algorithm. It works by recursively breaking a line into smaller and smaller segments and at each step changing the Y-value up or down by a random amount. The amount of change is reduced by some amount at each step to produce a rough or smooth looking mountain scape.</p>

<p>The blue lines (pictured right) indicate the location and amount of displacement from the previous iteration.</p>

<p>Here is an outline of the algorithm:</p>

<ol>
<li>Find the midpoint for the line segment</li>
<li>Assign the midpoint to the average of the endpoints (L + R) / 2</li>
<li>Generate a random number between -1 to 1 and multiply by the displacement value. Add this to the midpoint value.</li>
<li>Recursively subdivide this line and reduce the displacement value by a fixed amount (a roughness parameter)</li>
<li>Repeat previous until fractal is sufficiently detailed</li>
</ol>


<!-- more -->


<p>Note that the roughness parameter needs to greater than zero and less than one. Higher values result in rougher terrain and lower values result in smoother terrain. Typical values may range between 0.5 to 0.75 and depend on depth of recursion.</p>

<p>Also, note that you will have to determine what sufficiently detailed means. Arrays sized 2<sup>N</sup> + 1 are typically used to represent terrain height values. A good stopping point is when all array indicies are populated with values.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at a Javascript implementation of the algorithm above.</p>

<p>The if block on line two prevents infinite recursion. Also note, that we define a global array of floating point values called terrain_array. All values in the array are initialized to zero. We also defined a global variable for roughness.</p>

<p>Here is the code in action:</p>

<p><canvas id="canvas"></canvas></p>

<p>I added animation to show how easy it is to adapt this algorithm for side scrolling action. The code is available on <a href="https://github.com/nick-aschenbach/2d-fractal-terrain">github</a>.</p>

<script>
  var array_size = Math.pow(2, 9) + 1;
  var terrain_array = [];
  var roughness = 0.55;
  var initial_displacement = 50;
  var count = 0;

  $(function() {
    initializeArray();
    generateTerrain(0, array_size - 1, initial_displacement);
    drawTerrain();
  });

  function initializeArray() {
    for(var i = 0; i < array_size; i++) {
      terrain_array.push(0);
    }
  }

  function generateTerrain(leftIndex, rightIndex, displacement) {
    if((leftIndex + 1) == rightIndex) return;
    var midIndex = Math.floor((leftIndex + rightIndex) / 2);
    var change = (Math.random() * 2 - 1) * displacement;
