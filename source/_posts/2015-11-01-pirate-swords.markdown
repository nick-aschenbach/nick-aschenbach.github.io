Every year my work has a competition for who can come up with the best Halloween decorations. My team has the good
fortune of being in a large conference room, which gave us a distinct advantage over the pod layout elsewhere
in the building. Our team's resident creative genius [Sheena](https://twitter.com/SheenaEllenburg) came up with
the concept of dead pirates / death in the deep. As a companion to our pirate costumes, I created a basic
pirate sword design with a curved blade:

I cut the swords out of a sheet of 1/2" cabinet grade plywood. This is important because it has a flat and smooth
pre-finished surface, which I found very easy to prime and spray paint. I used silver metallic paint for the blade
portion and then used a metallic bronze for the hilt. Painters tape was used as masking to provide a sharp line between
the two colors.

As a final touch, I used a hot glue gun to attach 1/8" leather cord to the handle of the hilt.

Here are the sword designs in various formats, if you want to make your own:
